# Bidirectional BFS for the 8-Puzzle problem
A bidirectional Breadth First Search approach to solving the 8-Puzzle Problem in Python.

Data Structures Used:
* Queue to store the states in frontier
* Dictionary to check wether the state explored or not
* Dictionary to get the parent of each state (used to reconstruct the path)
